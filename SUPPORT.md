### How to Play

**Basic Controls:**
- **Tap** a tile to reveal it
- **Long press** a tile to place/remove a flag
- **Double tap** a revealed number to chord (automatically reveal adjacent tiles when the correct number of flags are placed)

**Goal:**
Reveal all safe tiles without hitting a mine. Numbers indicate how many mines are adjacent to that tile.

**Board Shapes:**
- **Square**: Classic 8-neighbor grid
- **Hexagon**: 6 neighbors per tile

### Settings

- **Safe First Click**: When enabled, your first tap will never hit a mine
- **Question Marks**: Enable to use question marks for uncertain tiles
